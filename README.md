# Go examples
Examples I used in my day-to-day work to learn and experiment with various new features/concepts in Golang.

Really, it is just like my Untitled dir, I just write dirty scripts-like go program to try out new things. The good thing though is that I used _good_ names for the files, so you will understand that (./mutex.g)[mutex.go] is actually about mutex in Golang.
